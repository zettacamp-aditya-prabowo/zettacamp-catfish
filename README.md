# Task

1. "Continue with the previous 9 cards “Popular Products”. Separate Styling into separate classes and combine them with multiple css classes. For example, Create class mb-1 for margin-bottom 1 rem, pt-1 for padding-top 1 rem, etc. Then combine them together to style an element.
Add 9 more cards, you can simply duplicate them. This time make the Text Header stick when the user scrolling down.
Create another page with 2 containers that has a list of items(use unordered list) in storage and a list of items sold. They are in different containers. Each of these containers is scrollable on their own. So when you scroll on a list of items in storage, it should not affect the list of items sold and vice versa."
